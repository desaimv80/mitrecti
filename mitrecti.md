Groups

Groups are activity clusters that are tracked by a common name in the security community. Analysts track these clusters using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, and threat actors. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Organizations' group definitions may partially overlap with groups designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity.

For the purposes of the Group pages, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Group to refer to any of the above designations for an adversary activity cluster. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as �Associated Groups� on each page (formerly labeled �Aliases�), because we believe these overlaps are useful for analyst awareness. We do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research.

Groups are mapped to publicly reported technique use and original references are included. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by Groups, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting. Groups are also mapped to reported Software used and attributed Campaigns, and related techniques for each are tracked separately on their respective pages.

Software
========

Software is a generic term for custom or commercial code, operating system utilities, open-source software, or other tools used to conduct behavior modeled in ATT&CK. Some instances of software have multiple names associated with the same instance due to various organizations tracking the same set of software by different names. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as �Associated Software� on each page (formerly labeled �Aliases�), because we believe these overlaps are useful for analyst awareness.

Software entries include publicly reported technique use or capability to use a technique and may be mapped to Groups who have been reported to use that Software. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by a piece of Software, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting.

�         Tool - Commercial, open-source, built-in, or publicly available software that could be used by a defender, pen tester, red teamer, or an adversary. This category includes both software that generally is not found on an enterprise system as well as software generally available as part of an operating system that is already present in an environment. Examples include PsExec, Metasploit, Mimikatz, as well as Windows utilities such as Net, netstat, Tasklist, etc.

�         Malware - Commercial, custom closed source, or open source software intended to be used for malicious purposes by adversaries. Examples include PlugX, CHOPSTICK, etc.

Campaigns
=========

The security community tracks intrusion activity using various analytic methodologies and terms, such as operations, intrusion sets, and campaigns. Some intrusion activity may be referenced by a variety of names due to different organizations tracking similar activity, often from different vantage points; conversely other times reported activity is not given a designated name.

Malicious cyber activity may be attributed to a threat group, or referenced as unattributed activity. Alternatively, complex cyber operations may involve multiple affiliated or unaffiliated groups, with each playing a unique role (ie. initial access, data exfiltration, etc).

For the purposes of the Campaigns page, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Campaign to describe any grouping of intrusion activity conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. Unnamed intrusion activity is cited using a unique ATT&CK identifier, otherwise the team will use the activity name as noted in public reporting. For named Campaigns, the team makes a best effort to track overlapping names, which are designated as �Associated Campaigns� on each page, as we believe these overlaps are useful for analysts. Campaign entries will also be attributed to ATT&CK Group and Software pages, when possible, based on public reporting; unattributed activity will simply reference �threat actors� in the procedure example.

Campaigns are mapped to publicly reporting techniques and original references are included. The information provided does not represent all possible techniques used in a Campaign but rather a subset that is available through open source reporting.

[Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005)

[Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) was a campaign that primarily targeted Colombian government organizations and private companies, particularly those associated with the energy and metallurgical industries. The [Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) threat actors distributed commodity malware and tools using generic phishing topics related to COVID-19, banking, and law enforcement action. Security researchers noted indicators of compromise and some infrastructure overlaps with other campaigns dating back to April 2018, including at least one separately attributed to [APT-C-36](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099), however identified enough differences to report this as separate, unattributed activity.

[C0014](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014)

[Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014)

[Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was a cyber espionage campaign that targeted organizations around the world, including in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspected China-based actors compromised government organizations and managed service providers, as well as aviation, construction, energy, finance, health care, insurance, offshore engineering, software development, and transportation companies.

Security researchers assessed the [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) actors used similar TTPs and tools as APT20, suggesting a possible overlap. [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was named after an observed command line entry by one of the threat actors, possibly out of frustration from losing webshell access.

[C0024](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024)

[SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024)

The [SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024) was a sophisticated supply chain cyber operation conducted by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) that was discovered in mid-December 2020. [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) used customized malware to inject malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software build process that was later distributed through a normal software update; they also used password spraying, token theft, API abuse, spear phishing, and other supply chain attacks to compromise user accounts and leverage their associated access. Victims of this campaign included government, consulting, technology, telecom, and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Industry reporting initially referred to the actors involved in this campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and SolarStorm.

In April 2021, the US and UK governments attributed the [SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024) to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); public statements included citations to [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016), Cozy Bear, and The Dukes. The US government assessed that of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of Solar Winds� Orion product, a much smaller number were compromised by follow-on [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) activity on their systems.
